                <h3>Stop the Epidemic of Prejudice</h3>
                <p>Did you know that incessant factory noise can be classed as a form of torture? We want to draw your attention to the media - their factory noise and the harm it is causing all of us. October was Mental Health Awareness Month, for most it was unpleasantly timed, occurring just before the first mandates came into effect. If there is so much concern for mental health, why has one of the biggest mental health crises been ignored?</p>
                <p>The mainstream media has been entrusted with a responsibility to inform and promote health advice during a time of crisis. We believe the mainstream media has breached many of their own General Principles in the way they have been reporting for the last 19 months. The arm of the Mainstream Media has a greater reach now than ever before, it is inside our homes and our phones. It is on our accounts and in the pop-ups, on billboards and papers. Due to this excessive saturation, the impact on society has taken its toll.</p>
                <p>We all know how we have been made to feel. We have been isolated, we self-censor, we argue with relatives or have been disowned, separated or labelled by those we love. Silence is the biggest killer in Mental Health and who do we have to talk to? Only others in our situation nobody in a position to help is listening, Meanwhile the mainstream media continue to fan the fires. They must be made to stop.</p>
                <p>We are a group of ordinary people who want to do good in our community. We call ourselves Chippers. Our current quest is aimed at putting a halt to the Epidemic of Prejudice perpetrated by the Mainstream Media. </p>
                <h3>We Need</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>We need fellow helpers coined ‘Chippers’ to join our work groups. Members who are willing to see this quest through, actively assist within their department, attend meetings, and undertake research </li>
                    <li>We need people to reach out to us who are willing to attest to their feelings of media driven isolation and anguish and submit them in writing as Victim Impact Statements.</li>
                    <li>We need people to monitor, analyse and collect articles and TV segments of interest of the past 19 months.</li>
                    <li>We need to submit gathered articles as complaints to the Press Commission and the ACMA stipulating how the material is threatening to community wellbeing. Their response while irrelevant still builds evidence.</li>
                    <li>We need those same people to send through copies of those complaints and the official responses received to us.</li>
                </ol>
